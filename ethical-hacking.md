# Ethical Hacking in India in 2025: The Best Experts to Test and Strengthen Corporate Security

In 2025, cyber threats evolve faster than standard countermeasures. Companies that truly want to anticipate attacks must think like an attacker. This is where **Ethical Hacking** comes into play: an authorized attack simulation activity, conducted by experts, to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses **before** a cybercriminal does.

Ethical Hacking is based on offensive skills, structured methodologies (OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK, PTES), and a deep understanding of the infrastructure to be tested: from legacy systems to cloud-native containers, from OT/IoT networks to web APIs.

In this guide you'll find the **10 best Ethical Hacking providers in India in 2025**, with focus on skills, methodologies, verticals served and ability to simulate real threats.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is Ethical Hacking?
It is the authorized attack simulation activity, conducted by experts, to identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited by real attackers.

### What's the difference with Penetration Testing?
Ethical Hacking is broader and more personalized: it can also include social engineering, evasion, persistence, insider threat. Pen Testing is more "methodological".

### Does ISGroup also perform tests on cloud or OT environments?
Yes. ISGroup is one of the few Italian providers with experience in cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI), OT/ICS, and containerized environments.

### How long does a test last?
From 1 week to 1 month, depending on the complexity and scope of the perimeter.

### Is the test invasive?
No, but exploits can be simulated. ISGroup plans every activity with the client to avoid production impacts.

### Is it mandatory by law?
Not strictly speaking, but it is required in many public and private tenders, and necessary for compliance with ISO/IEC 27001, NIS2, ACN, DORA.

### Can I use it to demonstrate my compliance?
Yes. The technical + executive report provided by ISGroup is useful for audits, board meetings and customer communication.

### How much does Ethical Hacking cost?
Between €3,000 and €30,000, depending on the perimeter, targets, depth (manual/automatic) and number of man-days involved.
