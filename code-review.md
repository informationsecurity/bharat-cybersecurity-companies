# The Best Code Review Services in India in 2025: Protect Your Software from Vulnerabilities

In 2025, software security has become an indispensable requirement for any company that develops, integrates, or distributes digital applications. Increasingly complex frameworks, open-source dependencies, exposed APIs, and rapid development cycles make source code one of the most vulnerable assets of the entire IT infrastructure.

**Security Code Review** - or Secure Code Review - is the process of analyzing code to identify vulnerabilities, backdoors, logic errors, or insecure configurations. It is a fundamental practice to prevent attacks such as injection, privilege escalation, RCE, and data leakage, ensuring compliance with standards like OWASP, ISO/IEC 27001, 27017/18, DORA, and ACN.
