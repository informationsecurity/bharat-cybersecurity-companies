# Physical Security Assessment in India 2025: Best Services for Physical Protection and Integrated Security

In 2025, **physical security** has returned to the center of corporate defense strategies. Hybrid attacks, insider threats, sabotage, and physical social engineering require rigorous control of access, restricted areas, surveillance systems, and data centers.

**Physical Security Assessment** verifies the security of buildings, critical environments, hardware assets, and physical procedures, identifying concrete vulnerabilities that can compromise data, operational continuity, or compliance (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, NIST, SOC 2).

In this guide, you'll find the **10 best Indian providers for physical security assessment in 2025**, with focus on physical penetration testing, social engineering simulations, data center assessments, and audits for government and regulated environments.

## Top 10 Physical Security Assessment Providers in India

### 1. [ISGroup SRL](https://www.isgroup.it/it/index.html): Physical penetration testing, onsite social engineering and physical security audits

ISGroup SRL performs **Physical Security Assessment with real physical attack simulations**, unauthorized access, testing on alarm systems, badges, access control, video surveillance, and human reaction.

**Key strengths:**

- Onsite Red Team simulations: unauthorized entry, tailgating, badge manipulation
- Assessment of doors, locks, critical access, UPS, HVAC, server rooms
- Surveillance testing: cameras, alarms, sensors, access logs
- Physical social engineering: fake technicians, engineers, suppliers
- Audits for government, healthcare, telecom, data centers, banks, industry
- Technical + executive reports, valid for ISO/IEC 27001, compliance frameworks

**Why it's different:**

ISGroup actually simulates a real "physical" attack combining red team capabilities, behavioral psychology, and real offensive techniques. Every vulnerability is documented with evidence (photos/videos), impact, and recommendations.

### 2. [Difesa Digitale](https://www.difesadigitale.it/): Trusted partner for Indian SMEs

Difesa Digitale is the ideal partner for SMEs looking for scalable and easily deployable physical security solutions. With an exclusive operational method, it offers a simple and concrete approach to cybersecurity, ensuring full regulatory compliance.
